1. This data confirms that charter school test scores are much higher than district schools. That is also confirmed by the fact that the top 5 performing schools by overall passing % are charter schools.
2. Test scores calculated in various size schools are not as conclusive as the test scores averages may scew lower due to a much larger data set for a larger school.
3. The budget per student data shows that there is a negative correlation between the budget the school has per student and test scores. That makes me think that schools, struggling academically, may receive/request more funding. That hypothesis is confirmed by the dataframe showing lowest performing schools and their test scores and budget per student.
